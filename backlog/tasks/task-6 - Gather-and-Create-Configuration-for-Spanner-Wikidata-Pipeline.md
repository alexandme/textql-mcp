## Description

Compile necessary configuration details and create a YAML config file to drive the ingestion and server processes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Spanner instance ID
- [ ] database ID
- [ ] project ID
- [ ] Vertex AI details are noted
- [ ] config/wikidata_poc.yaml file is created with the required settings
- [ ] Configuration is validated by loading it in a test script

## Implementation Plan

1. Create and switch to new Git branch spanner-graph-cline-task6
2. Gather configuration details from previous tasks (project ID, authentication, BigQuery dataset)
3. Decide on Spanner instance and database names for future tasks
4. Create config/wikidata_poc.yaml with all required settings
5. Write test script tests/test_config.py to validate configuration
6. Run validation script to ensure all keys are present
7. Update task with implementation notes and mark as done
