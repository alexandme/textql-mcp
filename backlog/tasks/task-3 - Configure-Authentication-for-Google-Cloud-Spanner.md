## Description

Set up authentication using Application Default Credentials to securely access Spanner services from the development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Google Cloud CLI is installed and authenticated
- [x] Application Default Credentials are configured (either via gcloud auth or service account key)
- [x] Authentication is verified using gcloud auth list

## Implementation Notes

- Verified gcloud installation with version 519.0.0.
- Confirmed active authentication with account a.alyushin@gmail.com via gcloud auth list.
- Checked existence of ADC file at ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json.
- Validated setup by successfully listing Spanner instances without authentication errors.
- No new configuration was required as authentication was already set up correctly.
