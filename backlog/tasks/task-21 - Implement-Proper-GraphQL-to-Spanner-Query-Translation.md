## Description

The current implementation uses a placeholder LLM chain that doesn't actually translate GraphQL queries to Spanner SQL queries. We need to implement proper query translation to enable natural language queries against the Wikidata graph database in Spanner.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GraphQL queries are properly translated to Spanner SQL
- [ ] Entity count queries work correctly
- [ ] Relationship queries return proper results
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large datasets
