## Description

Execute DDL to create tables for entities and edges in the Spanner database to form the graph structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] DDL for entities table is executed
- [x] DDL for edges table (interleaved) is executed
- [x] Indexes for entity_type and edge_type are created
- [x] Schema is verified with gcloud spanner databases ddl describe

## Implementation Plan

1. Create and switch to new Git branch spanner-graph-cline-task8
2. Update task file with implementation plan
3. Prepare DDL statements for entities and edges tables based on docs/spanner_graph_creation.md
4. Create DDL file docs/spanner_schema_ddl.sql with:
   - entities table (vertices) with vid, entity_type, label, description, etc.
   - edges table (edges) interleaved in entities for performance
   - Indexes on entity_type and edge_type
5. Execute DDL using gcloud CLI to create tables and indexes
6. Verify schema creation with gcloud spanner databases ddl describe
7. Handle any edge cases or errors
8. Document implementation notes and mark task as done

## Implementation Notes

- Created and switched to new Git branch: spanner-graph-cline-task8
- Used Google Cloud project: imperial-ally-429713-v1 (from task-2)
- Created DDL file `docs/spanner_schema_ddl.sql` with unified vertex and edge tables based on the plan in docs/spanner_graph_creation.md
- Successfully created schema with following structure:
  - **entities table**: Unified vertex table for all entity types with columns:
    - vid (STRING(36)): Primary key for vertex ID
    - entity_type (STRING(20)): Type of entity (Company, Person, Location, etc.)
    - label, description: Text fields for entity metadata
    - confidence_score (FLOAT64): For data quality tracking
    - type_specific_attributes, raw_claims (JSON): Flexible storage for entity-specific data
    - created_at (TIMESTAMP): With allow_commit_timestamp for automatic timestamping
  - **edges table**: Unified edge table for relationships with columns:
    - from_vid, to_vid (STRING(36)): Foreign keys referencing entities.vid
    - edge_type (STRING(50)): Type of relationship (EMPLOYED_BY, FOUNDER_OF, etc.)
    - start_date, end_date (DATE): For temporal relationships
    - role, rank: Additional relationship metadata
    - properties (JSON): Flexible storage for edge-specific data
    - created_at (TIMESTAMP): With allow_commit_timestamp
    - Primary key: (from_vid, to_vid, edge_type) for unique relationships
  - **Indexes**: Created idx_entities_type and idx_edges_type for efficient type-based queries
- Encountered and resolved issues:
  - Initial attempt to use INTERLEAVE IN PARENT failed because edges table references two different entities
  - Modified design to use FOREIGN KEY constraints instead, which is more appropriate for graph structures
  - Handled duplicate entity table error from first partial execution
- Verified schema creation with `gcloud spanner databases ddl describe`, confirming all tables, indexes, and foreign key constraints are properly created
- Schema is ready for data ingestion in subsequent tasks

Successfully created Spanner schema with unified entities and edges tables, foreign key constraints, and indexes. Resolved interleaving issue by using foreign keys for graph structure. Schema verified and ready for data ingestion.
