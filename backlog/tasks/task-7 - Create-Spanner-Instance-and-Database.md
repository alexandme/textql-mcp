## Description

Set up the Spanner instance and database to host the Wikidata graph schema.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Spanner instance is created with appropriate config
- [x] Database (e.g., wikidata-graph) is created within the instance
- [x] Creation is verified using gcloud commands

## Implementation Plan

1. Create and switch to new Git branch spanner-graph-cline-task7
2. Update task file with implementation plan
3. Create Spanner instance using gcloud CLI:
   - Instance ID: wikidata-graph-instance (from config/wikidata_poc.yaml)
   - Config: regional-us-central1 (cost-efficient for POC)
   - Nodes: 1 (minimal for POC, scalable later)
4. Create Spanner database within the instance:
   - Database ID: wikidata-graph-db (from config/wikidata_poc.yaml)
5. Verify creation:
   - List instances to confirm wikidata-graph-instance exists
   - List databases to confirm wikidata-graph-db exists
   - Describe instance to verify configuration details
6. Handle potential issues (existing instances, billing/quota)
7. Update task file with implementation notes and mark as done

## Implementation Notes

- Created and switched to new Git branch: spanner-graph-cline-task7
- Used Google Cloud project: imperial-ally-429713-v1 (from task-2)
- Successfully created Spanner instance with following configuration:
  - Instance ID: wikidata-graph-instance
  - Config: regional-us-central1
  - Node count: 1 (1000 processing units)
  - Display name: "Wikidata Graph POC"
  - Instance type: PROVISIONED (standard edition)
  - State: READY
- Successfully created database:
  - Database ID: wikidata-graph-db
  - State: READY
  - Version retention: 1 hour (default)
- Verified creation:
  - Confirmed instance appears in `gcloud spanner instances list`
  - Confirmed database appears in `gcloud spanner databases list --instance=wikidata-graph-instance`
  - Verified instance details with `gcloud spanner instances describe`
- Instance and database are ready for schema creation in task-8

Successfully created Spanner instance wikidata-graph-instance and database wikidata-graph-db with all configurations verified
