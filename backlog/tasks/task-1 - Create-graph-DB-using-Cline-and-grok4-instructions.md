## Description

Set up a graph database structure in Google Cloud Spanner following Cline and grok4 implementation guidelines. This task involves designing and implementing the graph schema, creating necessary tables and indexes, and ensuring proper integration with the existing textql-mcp system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Graph schema is properly designed and documented
- [ ] Tables and indexes are created in Spanner
- [ ] Graph operations (create/read/update/delete nodes and edges) are implemented
- [ ] Integration with textql-mcp is functional
- [ ] Unit tests cover all graph operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are documented
